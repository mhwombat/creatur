-- Utilities for working with genes that are encoded as a sequence of
-- bits, using a Binary Reflected Gray Code (BRGC).
--
-- A Gray code maps values to codes in a way that guarantees that the
-- codes for two consecutive values will differ by only one bit. This
-- feature can be useful in evolutionary programming because the genes
-- resulting from a crossover operation are likely to be similar to
-- the inputs. This helps to ensure that offspring are similar to
-- their parents, as any radical changes from one generation to the
-- next are the result of mutation alone.
